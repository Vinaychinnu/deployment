# Puzzle Game Deployment (CI/CD with Jenkins, Docker, Ansible)

This project demonstrates a **CI/CD pipeline** that deploys a static puzzle game using:
- **Ansible** → Installs Jenkins & dependencies on your server
- **Jenkins** → Automates building and running the game inside Docker
- **Docker** → Packages and serves the game
- **GitHub** → Stores the source code and pipeline configuration
